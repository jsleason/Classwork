            Our families are the heart and soul of Dance Marathon at the University of Michigan. We have supported over 500 families
            and children with a wide variety of disabilities receive treatment at Beaumont and Mott Children’s Hospitals.
            DMUM families have inspired more than 20,000 dancers to fight (and dance) for continued development in the field
            of pediatric rehabilitation. Dancers have had the privilege to build lasting relationships with our families
            through volunteering at therapies and at DMUM sponsored events. Over the course of the academic year, we host
            six different events bringing our DMUM families and dancer together to make unforgettable memories. But the family
            experience isn’t limited to just DMUM events, we are expanding our family program to include parental support
            networks and family connections.

        <h2>Victor Stories</h2>
        <h3>The Williamsons</h3>
        <p>
            This is our fifth year with Dance Marathon. I can't even begin to express my appreciation to all of the students that give
            their time and go above and beyond to help kids with disabilities and families. The money that is raised to help
            the families afford the therapies and equipment make it possible for kids like Johntez to have everything that
            they need to be successful in their rehabilitation. I personally love to see how happy Johntez is when he is
            surrounded by the members of his team. It is a joy for me to see him smile and laugh and enjoy life. Our lives
            revolve around rehabilitation and it's hard to see the daily struggles that Johntez goes through. Being involved
            in Dance Marathon, I know that we are never alone. I know that if I need some help or support, I can make a phone
            call or send an email and know that I have a whole team of people that care about Johntez and are willing to
            help at a moments notice. The caring and love that is shown through Dance Marathon to all the kids and their
            families is very much appreciated. Overall Dance Marathon has been a really great experience for me personally.
            To be surrounded by people who make a big difference and have a positive impact on the lives of kids with disabilities
            and their families, that alone let's me know that my son and I are a part of something very special. The Williamson
            family will be a part of Dance Marathon and the University of Michigan for life. Go Blue!

        <h3>The Reynolds</h3>
        <p>Dance Marathon has been one of my daughter’s favorite things to do. Amber is 12 and has Down syndrome and ADHD. She
            loves getting to know her team and going to the different activities. Her favorites are the Charity Ball and
            the Dance Marathon because she LOVES to dance. She actually gets upset when we have to leave for the night at
            VictorThon. She would dance all night if we let her. For me, it makes my heart happy to see all of the students
            making the kids feel special and including them in everything. We are looking forward to our third year participating.
            Thanks for all you do!! Kim Reynolds Mom to Amazing Amber</p>
