    The families and the therapies that Dance Marathon makes possible to the families are the cornerstones of our entire organization.
    The incredible progress made during these therapies is one of the main reasons our entire student network fundraises
    throughout the year and stands for 24 hours. By volunteering at therapies, you can watch a child beat the odds and conquer
    their greatest obstacles while interacting with our therapists, other children, and other DMUM volunteers.
    <hr> Some examples of therapies that you can volunteer at include Talk Around Town, Bowling, Yoga, Aquatic Fitness, Sports
    Club, TOP Soccer, Creative Coping, Teen Group, Tree Climbing, and Martial Arts.
